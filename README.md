Rule-Based Chatbot System 🤖
This project demonstrates a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python. The chatbot can respond to user inputs based on predefined patterns and rules, without using machine learning models. It is a foundational NLP project ideal for beginners learning how conversational agents work under the hood.

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ushalakshmi75/rulebased-chatbot-system.git
cd rulebased-chatbot-system
Open the notebook: jupyter notebook Rule_based_chatbot.ipynb
Follow the steps inside the notebook to test and interact with the chatbot.
🧠 Logic Overview The chatbot operates on a dictionary of predefined patterns and responses. When a user inputs a message, it:

Searches for a matching pattern using re.search

Returns the corresponding response if a pattern matches

Falls back to a default reply if no match is found

This simple framework can be expanded to support more complex interactions.
